## Problem 1

```{r dataframe}

library(tidyverse) 

set.seed(1234)

hw1df_df = tibble (
  x = rnorm(10), 
  vec_logical = c(x>0), 
  vec_char = c("today", "is", "Thursday", "and", "I", "am", "excited", "for", "Friday", "tomorrow"), 
  vec_factor = (factor(c("yes", "no", "maybe", "maybe", "yes", "maybe", "no", "yes", "yes", "no")))
)

mean(pull(hw1df_df, x))
mean(pull(hw1df_df, vec_logical))
mean(pull(hw1df_df, vec_char))
mean(pull(hw1df_df, vec_factor))
```

It appears that we can take the mean of a numeric/ double vectors and logical vectors, but you cannot take the mean of a character or factor vector.
