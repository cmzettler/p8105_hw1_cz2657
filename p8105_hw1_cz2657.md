``` r

    ## [1] NA

It appears that we can take the mean of a numeric/ double vectors and
logical vectors, but you cannot take the mean of a character or factor
vector.

`as.numeric(vec_logical)` `as.numeric(vec_char)`
`as.numeric(vec_factor)`

When attempting to convert logical or character variables to numeric
variables, RStudio produces an error that the object `vec_logical` or
`vec_char` is not found. However, it will convert a factor variable into
numeric levels in alphabetical order.

This does explain why it is not possible to take the mean of a character
variable, as R cannot deal with it numerically. It also likely explains
that R cannot take the mean of a factor variable unless it is converted
into a numeric variable. Finally, it is not clear why R can take the
mean of the logical variable (presumably counting TRUE as 1 and FALSE as
0), but cannot assign those values to the variable in converting to a
numeric variable.

\*\*WHY NO MEAN but, yes convert and vise versa?

## Problem 2
