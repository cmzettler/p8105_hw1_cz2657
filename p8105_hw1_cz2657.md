## Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(1234)

hw1df_df = tibble (
  x = rnorm(10), 
  vec_logical = c(x>0), 
  vec_char = c("today", "is", "Thursday", "and", "I", "am", "excited", "for", "Friday", "tomorrow"), 
  vec_factor = (factor(c("yes", "no", "maybe", "maybe", "yes", "maybe", "no", "yes", "yes", "no")))
)

mean(pull(hw1df_df, x))
```

    ## [1] -0.3831574

``` r
mean(pull(hw1df_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(hw1df_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1df_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1df_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1df_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We can take the mean of a numeric and logical variables, but not
character or factor variables.

Now let’s try to convert the variables to numeric:

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1df_df, vec_logical))

as.numeric(pull(hw1df_df, vec_char))

as.numeric(pull(hw1df_df, vec_factor))
```

We can convert logical and factor variables to numeric values, but
RStudio produces an error when trying to convert character variables to
numeric values.

-   This explains why it is not possible to take the mean of a character
    variable, as R cannot deal with it numerically.

-   It also demonstrates why R cannot take the mean of a factor
    variable, as it must first be converted into a numeric variable.

-   For logical variables, RStudio seems to store “TRUE” and “FALSE” as
    1 and 0, respectively, so it assigns those values explicitly when
    taking the mean, but shows only “TRUE” and “FALSE” in the dataframe.
    Therefore, a logical variable can be readily converted into a
    numeric variable.

## Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The `penguins` dataset describes the a group of penguins. Important
variables include `species`, `island`, and `sex`, which indicate the
type of penguin and where he/she resides. Other variables describe the
size of the penguin, including `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`,
`flipper_length_mm`, and `body_mass_g`. Finally, the variable `year` is
included for each penguin, which spans the years 2007 to 2009. The
dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is
200.9152047 mm, excluding missing values.

Now, I’ll construct a plot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species))+geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("first_scatterplot.pdf")
```

The plot is saved as a pdf.
